modularized-linux-training
==========================
How can we provide linux knowhow for all interested colleagues in form of an initial training, but also provide the used material for daily work? It should be easily and immediately accessible, so that you are able to have a quick look when you need it!

The final idea was to provide the training materials as man pages, that we roll out on every development machine we have.

bash
----
The bash man page is huge and contains everything you always wanted to know about bash. Unfortunately you have to search a lot if you don't exactly know what you are looking for. This course provides flattened material about using the bash and writing good bash scripts. All paragraphs have the **same name as in the original bash man page**. So if you want to dig deeper, just search for the paragraph name in the original bash man page.

To install (e.g. on debian) clone this repository and create the desired package:

    sudo apt-get install ruby-ronn
    git clone https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/modularized-linux-training.git
    cd modularized-linux-training/bash/
    make deb
    sudo dpkg -i dist/bash-essentials_1.1_all.deb
    
You can do the same for a **rpm** package. Just replace **make deb** with **make rpm** and use **rpm -i** instead of **dpkg -i**.

After the installation just type:

    man bash-essentials
    
Voil√†.
